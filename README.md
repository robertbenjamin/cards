# flashy-flash-card
My first independent project for GA, a flash card web app.

## The Initial Designs
These were whipped up in Sketch in 30 minutes so I had some sort of guideline to follow.

## Objectives
 * Pre-load the app with some data, and allow the user to switch through questions quickly using the keyboard.
 * Allow users to flip a card over to check the actual answer.
 * Allow users to mark whether they got a question right or not. 
 * Track which cards were incorrect, and re-display them until the user gets them right!

**Bonus:**

- Track scores over time (even if the page is reloaded)
- Include images on one or both sides of the flash card
- Let the user add flash cards (don't need to be saved across refreshes)
